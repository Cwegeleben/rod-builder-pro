# Design Studio v1 Plan · 2025 Edition

_Last updated: 2025-12-11_

## 1. Vision & Guiding Goals

- Deliver a guided rod-build workflow that keeps merchants inside a curated experience while sourcing authoritative catalog data from product_db.
- Treat importer automation as the source of truth: every DS-ready SKU now ships with roles, readiness flags, compatibility payloads, hero imagery, and ProductVersion pointers.
- Provide operations with auditable DesignBuild records (drafts → approvals → fulfillment) plus telemetry for SLA tracking and phased rollouts.
- Ensure storefront + admin experiences consume the same `/api/design-studio` stack behind the PRODUCT_DB_ENABLED and DESIGN_STUDIO_V1 feature gates.

## 2. Phase Map (A–E)

| Phase                                         | Status      | Focus                                                                                               |

The sections below expand on each phase.

## 3. Phase A — Data Foundations (Complete)

**Highlights**

- Step 6 (Batson core categories) and Step 7 (Batson secondary categories: reel seats, grips, end caps/gimbals, trim) are fully implemented. Evidence lives in `docs/importer/batson-step6-evidence-2025-12-10.md` and the Step 7 plan.
- Importer emits normalized `designStudioRole`, readiness flags, compatibility payloads, MSRP, hero imagery, and hashed version snapshots for every DS-ready SKU.
- `Product.latestVersionId` pointers are backfilled; `applyBatsonProducts` now writes Product + ProductVersion rows without gaps.
- `/api/design-studio/options` returns real product_db data for every Batson role when PRODUCT_DB_ENABLED=1 and DESIGN_STUDIO_V1=1.
- Diagnostics scripts (`reapplyBatsonBlanks.ts`, `dumpDesignStudioOptions.ts`, SQL snippets) have been exercised across every role and captured in evidence docs.

**Outcome**: All upstream data blockers are cleared. Remaining work focuses on consuming that data in the UI, persistence, and workflows.

## 4. Phase B — Step 8: UI Loader + Draft Persistence (Active)

Goal: Replace mocked storefront/admin hooks with real data, enforce compatibility filtering, and persist draft builds.

### B1. Replace mocked builder hooks

- Point `/apps/proxy/design` (and any helper hooks) at `/api/design-studio/options` + `/api/design-studio/config`.
- Map DS roles to builder panels explicitly:
  - `BLANK` → Blank selector
  - `HANDLE` → Grip/handle panel
  - `REEL_SEAT` → Reel seat panel
  - `GUIDE`, `TIP_TOP`, `BUTT_CAP`, `COMPONENT` → accessory panels
- Ensure loader caching honors PRODUCT_DB gating plus tenant tier logic.

### B2. Persist build drafts server-side

- Introduce temporary draft storage (SQLite/Redis/etc.) keyed by tenant/shop/session until Phase C migrations land.
- Capture selections, validation state, compatibility warnings, and user context.
- Expose a draft recovery endpoint so customers resume builds seamlessly.

### B3. Validation & filtering

- Use ProductVersion `designStudioCompatibility` payloads (ID/OD/length, finish tags, category arrays) to gate available parts.
- Add client + server validation for incompatible stacks; surface actionable errors.
- Emit telemetry for validation failures to feed later analytics.

### B4. Error handling & resilience

- Implement retry/backoff for loader fetches; present friendly UI when `/api/design-studio/options` is unreachable.
- Log draft save failures with tenant/shop payload hashes for debugging.

**Exit criteria**: Storefront wizard (still gated) reads real options, filters by compatibility, and safely stores/restores drafts without mock code paths.

## 5. Phase C — Prisma Migration for DS Models

With real usage patterns in hand, land the long-lived schema.

### C1. Schema design

- Models: `DesignBuild`, `DesignBuildDraft`, `DesignBuildEvent`, `DesignBuildAttachment` (if required), along with existing tenant tier fields.
- Enums: `DesignStudioRole`, `DesignBuildStatus`, `DesignBuildFulfillmentMode`, `DesignBuildEventType`. Roles must mirror the importer/product_db set documented in the appendix.
- Fields: compatibility hashes, submission metadata, SLA timestamps, assigned builder, webhook flags, attachment references.

### C2. Migration execution

- Author migration(s) and run `prisma migrate dev` locally; promote to staging/prod after typecheck/build verification and Fly deploy steps.
- Regenerate Prisma Client, update Remix loaders/services, and document the workflow.

### C3. Seeding & fallback

- Update `scripts/dev/seedDesignStudioSamples.ts` and tenant seeds to create sample DesignBuild rows.
- Backfill any Phase B drafts into the new tables once migrations land.

**Exit criteria**: Schema + generated clients are merged, and CRUD plumbing exists for later phases.

## 6. Phase D — Backfills for DS & Storefront

Codify a repeatable playbook now that the foundation is stable.

### D1. Command sequence

1. `npm run -s db:backfill:design-studio`
2. `npm run -s db:backfill:design-storefront`
3. Targeted reapply via `DATABASE_URL=... TARGET_CATEGORY=... npx tsx scripts/diagnostics/reapplyBatsonBlanks.ts`
4. Snapshot `/api/design-studio/options` payloads with `DESIGN_STUDIO_V1=1 PRODUCT_DB_ENABLED=1 npx tsx scripts/diagnostics/dumpDesignStudioOptions.ts <roles>`

### D2. Acceptance expectations

- All Batson roles return non-zero counts via `/api/design-studio/options`.
- `designStudioReady` and `latestVersionId` remain in sync after each run.
- Evidence docs only change when new roles/categories are enabled or regressions are captured.

## 7. Phase E — Admin & Storefront Deliverables

### E1. Admin (legacy "Phase 1")

- Persist `DesignBuildEvent` timeline entries for every admin action.
- Wire export-to-S3 button leveraging the existing export helper, capturing JSON + attachments.

### E2. Storefront Wizard (legacy "Phase 2")

- Finish React wizard (Baseline → Blank → Components → Review) using live data.
- POST endpoint creates `DesignBuild`, associates draft selections, and dispatches confirmation emails.
- Store inspiration uploads in S3 via `DesignBuildAttachment` references.
- Instrument drop-off + submission metrics and cover Starter/Plus flows with Playwright.

### E3. Fulfillment & Ops (legacy "Phase 3")

- Automate status transitions with SLA timers.
- Emit Slack notifications for `review` + `approved` actions and expose Enterprise webhooks with signatures.
- Schedule cron/reporting for SLA breaches and importer freshness.
- Support multi-location fulfillment metadata and validation rules.

### E4. Launch & Enablement (legacy "Phase 4")

- Publish KPI dashboards (Looker/Metabase), tenant enablement guides, Loom walkthroughs, and pilot checklists.
- Update support runbooks, escalation paths, marketing copy, and storefront block documentation.

## 8. Immediate Next Steps (Dec 2025)

1. **Canonical role confirmation** – lock DS role enum names (see appendix) and ensure importer, product_db, forthcoming Prisma migrations, and UI all reference the same values.
2. **Builder/UI alignment** – audit every builder panel and admin filter so each maps cleanly to the canonical role list; open issues for gaps before migrations.
3. **Step 8 schedule & execution** – plan and track sub-phases:
   - **8.1 Loader swap** – retire mock hooks and fetch `/api/design-studio/options` + `/api/design-studio/config` directly.
   - **8.2 Draft persistence & autosave** – implement server-side storage, recovery flows, and validation/error telemetry.
   - **8.3 Compatibility filtering** – enforce `designStudioCompatibility` gating in both UI and API handlers.

- **8.x Manual validation + telemetry loop (2025-12-11)** – Local sqlite refreshed via `seedDesignStudioSamples`, `backfill-design-studio`, and `backfill-design-storefront-products` (Batson). With `DATABASE_URL=file:/Users/cwegeleben/rbp-app/prisma/dev.sqlite`, `DESIGN_STUDIO_V1=1`, `PRODUCT_DB_ENABLED=1`, `SHOP_DOMAIN=core-sandbox.myshopify.com`, the diagnostics script now returns real options (4 blanks, 2 handles, 1 reel seat, 1 tip top, 2 components/accessories; guides pending) and emits `designStudio.storefront.options` telemetry for empty guide sets.

4. **Migration prep** – finalize the DesignBuild/DesignBuildDraft/Event schema proposal, circulate for review, and scaffold Prisma migrations.
5. **Regression + diagnostics bundle** – rerun `npm run -s typecheck && npm run -s build`, targeted importer diagnostics, and `/api/design-studio/options` snapshots after each Step 8 sub-phase to ensure product_db → options filtering remains intact.

## 9. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                                | Mitigation                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Loader ↔ API drift                 | Contract tests comparing `/api/design-studio/options` schema to storefront expectations.       |
| Draft persistence before migrations | Temporary storage abstraction with migration plan to backfill into Prisma tables later.        |
| Compatibility regressions           | Maintain diagnostics scripts + evidence docs; add unit tests asserting payload shape per role. |
| Tenant-tier confusion               | Centralize gating in `getDesignStudioAccess`; document the tier matrix in sandbox tenant docs. |

## 10. Timeline Snapshot

| Month        | Milestone                                                       |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dec 2025     | Phase B Step 8 implementation (live loaders, draft persistence) |
| Jan 2026     | Phase C migrations authored + applied; draft data backfilled    |
| Feb 2026     | Phase D backfill cadence finalized; Phase E1–E2 features active |
| Mar–Apr 2026 | Phase E3 fulfillment automation + analytics; pilot enablement   |

## 11. Role Reference

- `BLANK` – Rainshadow blanks with length/power/action compatibility.
- `HANDLE` – Fore/rear grips with ID/OD/length metadata.
- `REEL_SEAT` – Seats with bore, length, finish, and orientation.
- `GUIDE` / `TIP_TOP` – Guide sets + tip tops with ring/tube sizes.
- `BUTT_CAP` – End caps & gimbals (ID/OD/depth).
- `COMPONENT` – Trim pieces, hook keepers, miscellaneous accessories.

## 12. Summary

The 2025 edition confirms the importer + product_db foundations are done. Focus now shifts to Step 8 (live loaders + draft persistence), Prisma migrations, refreshed backfills, and the admin/storefront deliverables that take Design Studio V1 to launch.

## 13. Phase 3 — Interactive Design Studio (Draft-first)

Phase 2 is closed: Shopify delivery, Theme App Extension + App Proxy coexistence, no-JS fallback, Theme Editor smoke, and infrastructure discovery are all satisfied and stable. Phase 3 turns Design Studio from a validated preview into a merchant-facing drafting environment anchored on authoritative drafts.

### Phase 3 goals

- Deliver a draft-first canvas where merchants capture every design decision with product_db-backed parts and see immediate validation feedback.
- Give customers confidence that their in-progress builds persist safely across sessions without committing to checkout.
- Provide operations with a single source of truth draft artifact that can later convert into DesignBuild records once publishing phases resume.

### Merchant & customer problem solved

- Merchants currently juggle screenshots, emails, and spreadsheet trackers to explain builds; Phase 3 consolidates those choices into a living draft that never loses context.
- Customers lack a trustworthy way to iterate on premium rod builds asynchronously; Draft-first lets them explore combinations, understand compatibility, and return later knowing their work is intact.

### How Phase 3 differs from Phase 2

- Phase 2 validated platform constraints; Phase 3 assumes that groundwork and focuses on day-to-day usability and retention.
- Phase 2 emphasized loader fidelity; Phase 3 emphasizes interaction, recovery, and ownership semantics around drafts.
- Phase 2 tolerated manual fallback paths; Phase 3 requires predictable autosave and recovery so the experience is self-serve.

### Draft lifecycle (authoritative)

1. **Creation** — A draft is created the moment a merchant enters the builder (storefront or admin) and selects any actionable control; the system assigns a draft ID before submission flows exist.
2. **Updates** — Every selection change, compatibility warning dismissal, or note entry updates the draft payload and advances a monotonic revision counter to keep telemetry traceable.
3. **Autosave** — Autosave triggers on field blur, significant selection changes, and every 15 seconds of inactivity, showing an inline "Saved" state when the last revision lands; network failures surface non-blocking toasts with retry messaging.
4. **Ownership** — Drafts bind to the initiating session plus optional shop customer identity. Merchants can re-open tenant-owned drafts regardless of customer cookie state, but customers only see drafts they authored or that merchants explicitly shared.
5. **Expiration** — Drafts remain active for 30 days of inactivity; archival keeps metadata for analytics but hides expired drafts from customer pickers, ensuring the list stays curated.

### Interaction model (Draft-first scope)

- **Selectable/Editable** — Roles documented in Section 11 (blank, handle, reel seat, guides, tip top, butt cap, component) plus build name, notes, quantity, and finish preferences. Users can reorder components within allowed slots, toggle inspiration reference visibility, and reset individual panels.
- **Read-only** — Pricing, availability flags, fulfillment estimates, and importer provenance remain read-only callouts so Phase 3 stays draft-centric.
- **Scope limits** — No checkout, cart, or fulfillment handoff screens. No attachment uploads beyond a single inspiration link placeholder. Publishing to storefront pages or customer accounts is deferred.

### UX principles

- **Immediate feedback** — Component pickers respond within 200 ms via optimistic UI; compatibility failures inline-highlight affected roles with exact reasons and suggested fixes.
- **Failure + retry** — All saves surface deterministic retry affordances; offline or API errors never eject users from the flow and always explain what persisted vs. what needs reapplying.
- **Clear saved state** — The builder header shows "All changes saved" with a timestamp, turns to "Saving…" during in-flight work, and "Save failed" with retry CTA when persistence misses.
- **No surprise navigation** — Every flow stays inside the builder shell; outbound links open in new tabs and any attempted exit prompts users to confirm leaving unsaved work.

### Explicit non-goals

- Cart, checkout, payment, fulfillment automation, and post-Draft publishing logic remain out of scope.
- Multi-channel draft sharing, attachment uploads beyond simple inspiration notes, and automation of approvals/notifications stay deferred to later phases.
- Theme customization, metafield publishing, and tenant-level feature flag dashboards are not part of Phase 3.

### Success criteria

- ≥90% of builder interactions result in persisted drafts that can be reloaded within 2 seconds on the same tenant.
- Merchants can open an existing draft, make changes, and see autosave confirmation without manual refresh in ≥3 consecutive cycles.
- Customers returning via the same session see their draft list without re-entering selections, confirming ownership rules hold.
- Operations can export draft metadata (ID, last revision, role completeness, outstanding warnings) for readiness reviews even before DesignBuild records exist.
- A go/no-go review confirms Draft-first confines are met and no checkout/publishing assumptions leaked in, unlocking future implementation work.

## Addendum: Acceptance Criteria, Risks, Dependencies, and Role Definitions

### B. Risks and Safeguards

| Risk                         | Impact                     | Safeguard                                   |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| UI expecting old roles       | Picker breakage            | Canonical role registry + loader assertions |
| Supplier adds new roles      | Enum or schema drift       | Centralized enums + contract tests          |
| Hash drift in ProductVersion | Duplicate versions         | Hash stability tests                        |
| Compatibility mismatches     | Incorrect builds           | Compatibility contract tests                |
| Migration breaks envs        | Schema drift               | Migration dry-run + backups                 |
| Mock data left in code       | Inconsistent behavior      | Preflight check: "no mock DS data"          |
| SKU collisions               | Incorrect product identity | `supplierSlug + supplierSku` as unique pair |

### C. Phase Dependencies Map

- **A → B**: UI loader relies on stable product_db + roles.
- **B → C**: Migration schema must follow finalized loader + draft requirements.
- **C → D**: Backfills depend on the stabilized DS schema.
- **D → E**: Admin/storefront features require populated DS tables.
- Order: A (done) → B (active) → C → D → E → Launch.

### D. Canonical DS Role Appendix (2025 Edition)
